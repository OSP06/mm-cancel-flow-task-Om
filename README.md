Subscription Cancellation Flow - What's Been Built
A comprehensive subscription cancellation system designed specifically for job placement platforms, featuring intelligent retention strategies, A/B testing capabilities, and detailed user feedback collection.
What This System Does
This is a complete subscription cancellation flow that helps SaaS companies (particularly job placement services) reduce churn by understanding why users want to cancel and offering targeted retention strategies. Instead of a simple "cancel subscription" button, users go through an intelligent flow that adapts based on their responses.
Core Functionality Implemented
Intelligent User Routing
The system asks users a key question: "Have you found a job yet?" and routes them down different paths:
Path 1 - Job Success Flow: For users who found employment

Collects detailed survey data about their job search success
Gathers feedback on how the platform helped (or didn't help)
Celebrates their success and offers visa support services
Completes cancellation with positive messaging

Path 2 - Retention Flow: For users still job searching

Presents multiple 50% discount offers at strategic points
Collects detailed usage statistics and feedback
Asks for specific cancellation reasons with follow-up questions
Provides customized responses based on their concerns (price, platform issues, job relevance, etc.)

A/B Testing Framework

Automatically assigns users to test variants (A or B) using cryptographic randomization
Variants persist across user sessions
Tracks conversion rates and effectiveness of different approaches
Database stores variant assignments and outcomes for analysis

Job search metrics (applications sent, companies contacted, interviews completed)
Platform usage statistics
Detailed cancellation reasons with categorization
Price sensitivity data (what users are willing to pay)
Specific feedback for product improvement
Success rates and user satisfaction metrics
